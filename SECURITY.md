# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest version and supported Extended releases are the only currently supported versions, so 6.1 is the newest major version, whereas 6.1.2 is the latest version.
Support means that LetsChat may receive security updates, bug fixes and updates to documentation, though none of that is guaranteed, and the LetsChat project is not liable for any issues you have with the provided software.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, then report it in the issue tracker; don't expect a quick response or a reason for why it has been declined.
