There have been several LetsChat projects in the past that have been discontinued, this page contains some information about those projects.

### LetsChat LITE
LetsChat LITE was started on 19 Apr 2023 and was the first official spin of LetsChat, it was as the name suggests a smaller lightweight version of LetsChat. It had fewer features but it was still kept up-to-date. LetsChat LITE was built using code from LetsChat Social, where it stripped out some features. It was killed in favour of LetsChat <code>core</code> as the new <code>core</code> spin served the same purpose as the LITE spin but with a fully upstream-compatible structure. LetsChat LITE was officially killed off on Jul 28, 2024.

### LetsChat <code>core</code>
LetsChat <code>core</code> was started on Jul 28, 2024, and had only the bare minimum set of features, it was compatible with upstream Kwitter but was very limited. The <code>core</code> spin was discontinued on Aug 13, 2024, a few days before the release of 6.1 because LetsChat 6.1 switched to a slightly more Kwitter-compatible directory structure.

### LetsChat Social
LetsChat Social was a full social media platform built on top of the LetsChat web framework and was released the same day alongside LetsChat, it stopped development on Jul 1, 2023. LetsChat Social now lives on in <a href="https://project-letschat.github.io/NovaChat/index.html">NovaChat</a> as <a href="https://project-letschat.github.io/NovaChat/index.html">NovaChat</a> was built directly off of code from LetsChat Social.
