The <code>addUser()</code> function is located in the <code>kwitter.js</code> file, it carries out the login process in LetsChat. The <code>index.html</code> page and login pages in general depend on this function (indirectly depending on the <code>kwitter.js</code> file). It also requires having a <code>kwitter_room.html</code> page/file.

This line fetches the value from the id <code>user_name</code> and attaches the value to the <code>user_name</code> variable:
```JavaScript
user_name = document.getElementById("user_name").value;
  ```
An example of how to get the user to attach a value to the id <code>user_name</code> which is typically done through the <code>index.html</code> page:
```HTML

<input type="text" name="user-field" id="user_name">

```
This line stores the <code>user_name</code> in the browser's local storage. By saving data in local storage, it allows the data to persist even if the browser is closed:
```JavaScript

localStorage.setItem("user_name", user_name);

```
This line redirects the user to the <code>kwitter_room.html</code> page, completing the login process:
```JavaScript

window.location = "kwitter_room.html";

```

After this process, the <code>kwitter_room</code> page should display the entered <code>user_name</code> value that was previously entered on the <code>index.html</code> login page.
